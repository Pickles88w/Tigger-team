Flappy Bird Type of game 
This is the github for Tiger-Team flappy bird game project being made in unreal engine.
The game will utilize c++ since this is  the native languge when using UnReal Engine. This ReadMe File in the Test-Changes-Branch will be were we explain the contents of the source code. We will do all the coding and changes to the "Test-changes-branch" before moving it into The "Main" Branch. This will insure the project will not develop any bugs along the development process. After testing and verifying the features/changes made to the "Test-changes-branch" code we will then move it to the "Main" Branch. This ensures we keep the Main branch fully funcional & allows Testing with code changes without messing up the working version on the "Main" branch.
